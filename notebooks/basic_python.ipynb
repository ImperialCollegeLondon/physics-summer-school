    "The third most common collection type used in Python is the Dictionary, or dict, which store mappings from keys to values. For every key, there is a value. Unlike lists and tuples, dicts do not preserve the order of the objects in the collection, and rather than the accessing the contents with indices, they are accessed with keys. Values can be any Python object, keys are usually strings, but it is possible to use certain other objects as keys. Dictionary literals are written as a comma-separated list of key:value pairs, with a colon separating key from value, surrounded by (curly) braces. Dict items are accessed using the same square bracket notation as for lists and tuples, but with a key instead of an integer index.\n",
